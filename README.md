![SNEAKERS](https://github.com/juliocolon/SEI_CRUD_Application_Project-2/blob/main/public/images/Sneakers%20App.png)

## Technogies 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS, JSX, REACT, Express, MongoDB

## Getting Started
- The SNEAKERS App is an online marketplace for the reselling of sneakers
- Users must sign-up with a username and password before being able to utilize the application
- Users will then need to sign-in with their created log-in credentials, once logged in they will be redirected to the Index page 
- Within the Index view, a user will be able to view all of the sneakers available for sale 
- The user can post a sneaker for resell, by submitting the form when clicking on the "Sell" button located in the nav
- The user can edit and or delete their created post

## Approach
Implemented CRUD operations, moved on to styling with CSS Bootstarp 4.6, implemented log-in authentication and user schema to connect to MongoDB, made navigation dynamic according to when a user is logged in or out.

## Next Steps
- I would like to implement the ability to view a user profile, where their listings are shown and they can edit or delete 
- I would like the index view to only display all listings and allow users to add a product to their cart 
- I would like the user to be able to add a file from their local machine and the file be stored on my server, to then utilize in the Index and Show page views 
- I would like to improve the responsiveness of the application
- I would like to add some additional views to improve the UX when a user creates an account and logs in 
- I would like to user third party user authentication APIs
