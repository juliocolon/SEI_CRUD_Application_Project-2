## Getting Started
- The SNEAKERS App is a marketplace for the reselling of sneakers
- Users must sign-up with a username and password before being able to utilize the application
- Users will then need to sign-in with their crated log-in credentials, once logged in they will be redirected to the Index page 
- Within the Index view, auser will be able to view all of the sneakers available for sale 
- The user can post a sneaker for resell, by submitting the form when clicking on the "Sell" button located in the nav
- The user can edit and or delete their created post

## Approach
Implemented CRUD operations, moved on to styling with CSS Bootstarp 4.6, implemented log-in authentication and user schema to connect to MongoDB, made navigation dynamic according to when a user is logged in or out.
